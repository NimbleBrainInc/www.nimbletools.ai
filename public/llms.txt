# NimbleTools

> Open source MCP runtime for deploying Model Context Protocol servers on your own infrastructure.

## What is NimbleTools?

NimbleTools is an open source runtime that makes it easy to deploy, manage, and scale MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers. It's built for Kubernetes and designed for developers who want to run MCP servers on their own infrastructure.

MCP (Model Context Protocol) is an open standard that enables AI assistants to connect to external data sources and tools. NimbleTools provides the infrastructure layer to run these MCP servers reliably.

## Key Features
